## Project Mission Statement

To communicate a new approach to the software development lifecycle that embraces the non-deterministic
nature of LLMs.

## Rules

Follow only these rules and do not deviate from them.

- Do not directly edit files in generated directories, such as `dist`. Instead, those files should be derived from source code.
- Do not modify anything in the `cypress` directory
- Do not modify `cypress.config.json`
- Do not modify any actual tests or test cases
- Always ask for permission before installing any packages
- Always run the project tests via `npm run test` to confirm your changes
- Feel free to create temporary files, but clean them up when you're done
- Feel free to make commits, but note that they were authored by you
- Code, CSS styles, and HTML elements that are not covered by tests should be removed
- If you start a process (i.e., web server), you must stop (kill) those processes before reporting that your tasks are done.

## Design Goals

Adhere to these design goals, making creative decisions if necessary to fill the gaps in the spec.

- Our site's design is modern and technical.
- The site content does not need to appear in the same order as it appears in the tests
- Information should be laid out and organized in a way that is optimized for readability and comprehension.
- Semantic HTML elements should be favored over generic containers.
- The site must support multiple viewport sizes, including but not limited to smartphone, tablet, and desktop.
- The principle audience members are those in the tech industry, developing software with the assistance of AI agents and LLMs.
